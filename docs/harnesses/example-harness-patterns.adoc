= Example Harness Patterns
:toc: macro
:toclevels: 2

Small testing and demo harness patterns for `proven-concat` cores. These are runtime-agnostic and focus on validating core inputs and outputs.

== Pattern: Pure Input Table

* Build a table of validated inputs and expected outputs.
* Use `Either` or `Maybe` to capture failure modes.

== Pattern: Error Snapshot

* Feed known-bad inputs and assert error tags.
* Store error snapshots as golden records for regression checks.

== Pattern: Parser Roundtrip

* Parse input into validated types.
* Serialize back to a canonical form.
* Compare to expected canonical output.

== Pattern: Constraint Fuzz (Bounded)

* Generate bounded inputs within known constraints.
* Ensure all generated inputs pass validation.
* Check boundary conditions explicitly.

== Pattern: Cross-Format Parity

* Convert the same dataset through JSON/TOML/YAML paths.
* Compare resulting validated structures for equivalence.
